    title: 'A Personal Climate Crisis',
    date: '9/15/19',
    text:
      "Where to begin? For as long as I can remember I've been aware of the impending climate crisis that is our current existential predicament. I grew up with a father who, born in 1958, was a true hippie: open minded, easy going, a grateful dead-head and aware. He was both granola, laid back and yet motivated in his career and personal life. We went to museums, symphonies and festivals alike. The epitome of a classic American work ethic and responsibility fused with the liberation of the 1960s, rock'n roll and new social perspectives that came along with the tumultuous Vietnam war era. I had no choice but to be exposed to this same awareness. In the lyrics of his favorite artists (Dylan, Pink Floyd, the Beatles) and the media he showed me (Deer Hunter, Whale Wars, Daily Show), I was taught to analyze, question and reflect on our societal shortcomings. This combination, of a creeping climate awareness and my education, was both the best, and worst aspect of my early years. It taught me to question, find truth and appreciate the world around me. But it also laid a foundation for a perpetual existential crisis. \n I grew into an attitude that my formative culture was lost. We were unable to see the obvious, impending threat. A few spoke of it, but many dismissed or even laughed at the concerns of granola munching hippies. I watched as many intellectuals proposed answers, which were just as quickly dismissed or ignored by the culture at large as my comments to friends were in the lunchroom. As an individual, I can't be more grateful for my perspective and education that my parents provided me. But, this led to recurring periods of depression, isolation and escapism. Metal (the music genre) is one place I've found solace and companionship in this mess. \n As I matured, and went to Eckerd College, I began a period of reflection. How do I fit in this mess? What do I do? Am I responsible and if so, can I even fix it? A class on Environmental Ethics rattled my understanding of just how hard it would be for society to climb this proverbial hill that is upending our entire way of life. He laid bare our contradiction of being so motivated to fix climate change while living in air conditioned rooms in Florida. We wanted to reduce our impact yet ate meat and all sorts of foods wrapped in plastic. We felt good about recycling, but those minor acts were drowned out by the structural issues around how we flew to college by plane or drank coffee shipped halfway around the world. This led to a period of consideration of who was responsible for this mess, and who should have to sacrifice what to remedy it. The conclusion was that we, the first world, must change moreso than most of humanity. Class discussions became heated as the true level of necessary sacrifice dawned upon us. Some students walked out, unable to cope with the cognitive dissonance of feeling like they care and do everything they can while at the same time their existence in this system is a problem in and of itself. \n So now what? I've confirmed our society is built upon a toxic relationship with the environment we depend on, and my existence alone is a problem given the system I rely on. What do I do? From what I see online, in the news, and in school, even the experts with connections and power are unable to nudge us, the behemoth that is our society careening towards catastrophe, away from demise. How do the powerless contribute significantly? How can an individual who does everything they can counteract the cruise ships burning bunker fuel every day so lazy people can see the world without having to leave the comfort of their amusement park on water all while ignoring the impending crisis that will affect their child (blissfully unaware of their likely future) playing in the pool nearby? I suppose enough pina coladas and french fries makes that voluntary ignorance a bit easier. I digress. \n Is it enough to do everything within your power to make your life environmentally friendly? Is it enough to bike to work, drive an electric car, reduce meat consumption and recycle? If you're the minority, isnt it futile? Isnt there an ever-present, inescapable guilt that comes with flying to visit family for the holidays? My parents live in separate cities, and I can't just stop seeing one half of my family in the name of reducing emissions, can I? \n This is the purgatory I find myself in, and unable to escape. On some level, the argument could be made that I should just off myself. I've maintained the stance that I will not have children both to reduce my impact and to prevent whatever suffering they may encounter due to climate related global instability. Does that account for my emissions when I travel? \n My father has continued living a first world life, but does what he can to reduce his impact in a system inherently built on excess. From eating local, to using the painfully inadequate public transport that Seattle provides, to driving an electric car, to paying more for clean energy in his house, to working for an energy optimization software company, he does more than most. He joined a local climate change lobby and has done much to impact local policy and his community. I could not be more proud of him for acting on his concerns. But I see his frustration, his desire to hold onto hope with white knuckles while reading yet another abysmal headline that we in fact have 12 years, not 35. A headline saying we've elected a man hellbent on embodying the antichrist who thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax. A headline saying that even if we were able to stop carbon emissions today, the earth would continue warming for 20 years and potentially produce positive feedback loops (meaning it may already be out of our control). In light of new research, I find optimism to be rather naive. \n My gut reaction is to do something rather than nothing. I'm caught between two primary perspectives on how best to contribute: option one is to stay within the system, educate myself, work my way into an organization and write policy or invent some thing or build some business that might help our society heal our relationship with nature; option 2 is to make my individual life as sustainable as possible via an electric vehicle, growing much of my food, eating local, no flying, no world travel, going vegan and worst of all, giving up coffee. The first path may end up contributing a lot on a large scale, but in all likelihood, it won't and won't matter because very few people seem willing to sacrifice what is necessary. The rich stand to lose a lot of money if we make the necessary drastic changes to our society, and we know who owns the policy makers these days. The second option will definitely and measurably contribute, it won't affect much else besides myself and my community, and again will in all likelihood not matter in the grand scheme of things. But at least I could do this without obstruction by the powerful in our world. Perhaps a hybrid approach is option 3, but again, it will probably not matter given how much has to be done in such a short time. At least I could say I tried, in the end. \n A fourth, rather indulgent, option exists which is to enjoy life while I can. My career is very profitable, and I could simply enjoy life, see friends, play games and travel until that time comes wherein society collectively realizes the wonderfully excessive status quo is over and shit really starts hitting the fan. I've met a number of people who, when I present these options, say they'll just kill themselves when it gets bad enough. Their reasoning is we aren't going to fix things in time and whatever hardships (lack of food, safety or healthcare) that follow any significant global instability would not be worth struggling through. I've also met a lot who hope that we can still address this climate issue, but given the immense changes that need to happen, and the ever shortening timeline with which we have to enact them, I am realistically skeptical of that optimism. Am I to run from society and start a farm far away from any large cities or do what I can, in the city and go down with the rest of 'em when it all collapses? Is it selfish to run away and hide? \n I dont have answers to these questions. If anyone does, I'd love to know. These two avenues take time to build, and require commitment now to see results in many years. My professor seems to have chosen to stay within the system and feels that education is the best route within his capacity. \n I suppose there isnt a flowery, optimistic and light hearted ending to this. I know that I'm not alone in this line of thinking, and wish there was an easy answer for those of us who are paying attention. I remember when I was young teachers said \"you'll do fine if you simply pay attention\". I wish it were that simple.",
