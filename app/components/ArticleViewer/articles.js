    text:
      "I was born and raised on an island near Seattle, Washington. Exploring the outdoors has always been a part of my life. After earning my bachelor's in Computer Science (minors in Marine Science and Philosophy) at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida, I moved to Denver, Colorado with my (then) girlfriend. We built our careers and explored the mountains for 3 years before dropping it all to travel the world and get married. We explored parts of South & Central America as well as Asia. We spent a month working on farms in Hawaii learning about permaculture, which had a lasting impact on our lives and desires. We were married in Costa Rica on a sandy beach, barefoot in the waves. After a brief stint in Singapore, and *almost* running out of money in Thailand, we moved to Seattle and resumed our careers. \n Passionate, decisive and a solid communicator, I bring diverse development experience specializing in user interfaces and data visualization. My background includes complex web applications, clean user experiences and RESTful micro-services. I'm fluent in industry-leading software tools and processes, enabling me to produce quality code that exceeds expectations. I've worked on a variety of complex SaaS applications involving ReactJS, Typescript, NodeJS, Java and SQL. I've worked in team-based, agile environments and am familiar with Kanban and Scrum development. I deliver excellence in all stages of the SDLC including inception, design, development, testing and maintenance. I was a software tutor and kayak tour guide before I began my career, showing my ability to lead, teach respectfully and meet the expectations of both my employer and the customer. My ability to effectively communicate feature parameters, prototype and wire-frame my ideas, diagnose process hiccups and effectively work through unexpected hurdles sets me apart from many developers. \n When I'm not at work, I spent my time exercising, drumming, writing, making music and enjoying all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Throw a little gaming into the mix during the many rainy months. During what little sun we get here, I'm usually playing beach volleyball, digging up crystals in the mountains, or partying at a festival. I'm not an expert at any of these things, except maybe the festivals :), but choose to experience as much as possible. Diversity and discovery drive me to explore both my passions and the world.",

    title: 'A Personal Climate Crisis',
    date: '9/15/19',
    text:
      "Where to begin? For as long as I can remember I've been aware of the impending climate crisis that is our current existential predicament. I grew up with a father who, born in 1958, was a true hippie: open minded, easy going, a grateful dead-head and aware. He was both granola, laid back and yet motivated in his career and personal life. We went to museums, symphonies and festivals alike. The epitome of a classic American work ethic and responsibility fused with the liberation of the 1960s, rock'n roll and new social perspectives that came along with the tumultuous Vietnam war era. I had no choice but to be exposed to this same awareness. In the lyrics of his favorite artists (Dylan, Pink Floyd, the Beatles) and the media he showed me (Deer Hunter, Whale Wars, Daily Show), I was taught to analyze, question and reflect on our societal shortcomings. This combination, of a creeping climate awareness and my education, was both the best, and worst aspect of my early years. It taught me to question, find truth and appreciate the world around me. But it also laid a foundation for a perpetual existential crisis. \n I grew into an attitude that my formative culture was lost. We were unable to see the obvious, impending threat. A few spoke of it, but many dismissed or even laughed at the concerns of granola munching hippies. I watched as many intellectuals proposed answers, which were just as quickly dismissed or ignored by the culture at large as my comments to friends were in the lunchroom. As an individual, I can't be more grateful for my perspective and education that my parents provided me. But, this led to recurring periods of depression, isolation and escapism. Metal (the music genre) is one place I've found solace and companionship in this mess. \n As I matured, and went to Eckerd College, I began a period of reflection. How do I fit in this mess? What do I do? Am I responsible and if so, can I even fix it? A class on Environmental Ethics rattled my understanding of just how hard it would be for society to climb this proverbial hill that is upending our entire way of life. He laid bare our contradiction of being so motivated to fix climate change while living in air conditioned rooms in Florida. We wanted to reduce our impact yet ate meat and all sorts of foods wrapped in plastic. We felt good about recycling, but those minor acts were drowned out by the structural issues around how we flew to college by plane or drank coffee shipped halfway around the world. This led to a period of consideration of who was responsible for this mess, and who should have to sacrifice what to remedy it. The conclusion was that we, the first world, must change moreso than most of humanity. Class discussions became heated as the true level of necessary sacrifice dawned upon us. Some students walked out, unable to cope with the cognitive dissonance of feeling like they care and do everything they can while at the same time their existence in this system is a problem in and of itself. \n So now what? I've confirmed our society is built upon a toxic relationship with the environment we depend on, and my existence alone is a problem given the system I rely on. What do I do? From what I see online, in the news, and in school, even the experts with connections and power are unable to nudge us, the behemoth that is our society careening towards catastrophe, away from demise. How do the powerless contribute significantly? How can an individual who does everything they can counteract the cruise ships burning bunker fuel every day so lazy people can see the world without having to leave the comfort of their amusement park on water all while ignoring the impending crisis that will affect their child (blissfully unaware of their likely future) playing in the pool nearby? I suppose enough pina coladas and french fries makes that voluntary ignorance a bit easier. I digress. \n Is it enough to do everything within your power to make your life environmentally friendly? Is it enough to bike to work, drive an electric car, reduce meat consumption and recycle? If you're the minority, isnt it futile? Isnt there an ever-present, inescapable guilt that comes with flying to visit family for the holidays? My parents live in separate cities, and I can't just stop seeing one half of my family in the name of reducing emissions, can I? \n This is the purgatory I find myself in, and unable to escape. On some level, the argument could be made that I should just off myself. I've maintained the stance that I will not have children both to reduce my impact and to prevent whatever suffering they may encounter due to climate related global instability. Does that account for my emissions when I travel? \n My father has continued living a first world life, but does what he can to reduce his impact in a system inherently built on excess. From eating local, to using the painfully inadequate public transport that Seattle provides, to driving an electric car, to paying more for clean energy in his house, to working for an energy optimization software company, he does more than most. He joined a local climate change lobby and has done much to impact local policy and his community. I could not be more proud of him for acting on his concerns. But I see his frustration, his desire to hold onto hope with white knuckles while reading yet another abysmal headline that we in fact have 12 years, not 35. A headline saying we've elected a man hellbent on embodying the antichrist who thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax. A headline saying that even if we were able to stop carbon emissions today, the earth would continue warming for 20 years and potentially produce positive feedback loops (meaning it may already be out of our control). In light of new research, I find optimism to be rather naive. \n My gut reaction is to do something rather than nothing. I'm caught between two primary perspectives on how best to contribute: option one is to stay within the system, educate myself, work my way into an organization and write policy or invent some thing or build some business that might help our society heal our relationship with nature; option 2 is to make my individual life as sustainable as possible via an electric vehicle, growing much of my food, eating local, no flying, no world travel, going vegan and worst of all, giving up coffee. The first path may end up contributing a lot on a large scale, but in all likelihood, it won't and won't matter because very few people seem willing to sacrifice what is necessary. The rich stand to lose a lot of money if we make the necessary drastic changes to our society, and we know who owns the policy makers these days. The second option will definitely and measurably contribute, it won't affect much else besides myself and my community, and again will in all likelihood not matter in the grand scheme of things. But at least I could do this without obstruction by the powerful in our world. Perhaps a hybrid approach is option 3, but again, it will probably not matter given how much has to be done in such a short time. At least I could say I tried, in the end. \n A fourth, rather indulgent, option exists which is to enjoy life while I can. My career is very profitable, and I could simply enjoy life, see friends, play games and travel until that time comes wherein society collectively realizes the wonderfully excessive status quo is over and shit really starts hitting the fan. I've met a number of people who, when I present these options, say they'll just kill themselves when it gets bad enough. Their reasoning is we aren't going to fix things in time and whatever hardships (lack of food, safety or healthcare) that follow any significant global instability would not be worth struggling through. I've also met a lot who hope that we can still address this climate issue, but given the immense changes that need to happen, and the ever shortening timeline with which we have to enact them, I am realistically skeptical of that optimism. Am I to run from society and start a farm far away from any large cities or do what I can, in the city and go down with the rest of 'em when it all collapses? Is it selfish to run away and hide? \n I dont have answers to these questions. If anyone does, I'd love to know. These two avenues take time to build, and require commitment now to see results in many years. My professor seems to have chosen to stay within the system and feels that education is the best route within his capacity. \n I suppose there isnt a flowery, optimistic and light hearted ending to this. I know that I'm not alone in this line of thinking, and wish there was an easy answer for those of us who are paying attention. I remember when I was young teachers said \"you'll do fine if you simply pay attention\". I wish it were that simple.",

      'Childhood is the period of life when you idolize and look up to your parents. They are perfect, and make up much of your world. They care for you, feed you and teach you. Over a decade later you hit adolescence and start to understand more about them. You see their flaws, and you realize they are just like any other person: complicated, emotional, ever-changing and unsure of what is the right thing to do. This is a tough phase, because not only are you attempting to find yourself in this world, but your role models and guides throughout all of life are now not so perfect. Someday, you find adulthood and come to accept your parents for who they are, flaws included. Maybe you explore ways you might help them, as they did you for so many years. It may be as simple as taking them on their dream vacation, or changing a diaper. Or it may be as complicated as helping a parent through depression, or the slow, agonizing loss of memory and mental stability that may eventually challenge every one of us. \n There is no easy way to go through this transition: you become the responsible party and your parents become the ones who need checking-up on. At first, it doesn’t even seem real. You’re home visiting and going about the usual family reunion activities: playing cards, watching sports, making food, cleaning the kitchen, going on walks. You ask about their life, what they do, who they’re spending time with, how their golf game is going. You check in on distant relatives. You reminisce about your childhood and the good times they showed you. You discuss the first time, when you were well under driving age, that your mom let you sit on her lap and drive down the driveway into the garage. \n This is one of many trips you’ve made to visit them, and like all the trips before, you know what to expect. All seems normal, then you hear the beginnings of a familiar story. It’s your mother explaining to you why she crosses the street when walking the dog. ‘It’s because our dog is unpredictable and we don’t want her near other dogs, it’s too risky.’ Our dog is almost ten years old, and you were there helping raise her as a puppy. She informs you, as if you didn’t raise the dog, that our dog isn’t dog-friendly. You think to yourself ‘huh, I suppose she should know that I know this, but maybe she’s just reiterating it because she’s nervous’.  You brush it off and continue on the walk, making small talk about life, laughing about how excited the dogs get when they see ducks. You forget about it. \n You find yourself on the golf green. Your mother lines up for a drive, and swings. A good hit, you can tell she’s improving. It’s your turn and you line up, as you have so many times with her, on this very same fareway, to take your turn. She mentions that the hole is around the trees, to the left, and that you’ll want to aim towards the right side, to line up your next shot. Okay, mom. Thanks! But that tickling little voice is back. You’ve heard that tip many times. She’s told you it many times. But she doesn’t remember. It hits you like a driver to the face, and you slice. \n While she’s encouraging you with tips and positivity after your mistake, as she has for decades, you’re not fully listening. The competent, successful and composed mother you’ve known your entire life, is slipping. It’s not much. It’s simply something that could’ve been repeated by anyone. But you know her for who she used to be. And for the first time, that image is fading. Like a sign left out in the sun for one too many summers. The fiery, intelligent and wise person you’ve always admired is ever so slowly fading. \n Age is a funny thing. As a child you want to be older. You want to know more. You want others to trust you and respect you. You want them to take you seriously, as they take seriously other adults. You want to drive a car and buy things that only adults can buy. You want to go places on your own. Children only 5 years your senior seem so mature. Once you’re in high school, you start that slow transition into understanding that there is no magical threshold you cross, where afterwards you’re officially and finally an adult. You can now buy and see adult things. People talk to you like an adult. You get a job and meet people of all ages and lifestyles. In fact, at some point, you meet adults that you realize aren’t really that grown up. For some reason, they just didn’t get as far as you already are, and you’re barely beginning. \n It suddenly dawns on you why wisdom is so important in a person, and why one should inquire with elders about life, even if the only thing you learn is another tactic to avoid mistakes. In a sense, you anticipate age like you did as a child, or perhaps the wisdom that comes with it. It can be comforting to know that someday, you may have much of this chaos figured out. I hope that for you, this period lasts a long, long time, and that the next never comes. \n But for many, it does. You visit home one day, and see firsthand what age sometimes does to a person. It starts small, with little comments here and there. Short stories you’ve heard before, but for some reason an itch is telling you they truly believe they’re telling you for the first time. One moment, they are wise and happily retired, and the next, their slow disappearance has begun, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. \n So what do you do? What can you do? Nothing. You live on. They live on. You visit as often as possible, and you laugh at the same story, over and over, because they told the same joke and read the same stories to you, over and over, to make you happy. After all, time is fleeting, and what else is there to do but bring as much happiness into this world as you can. Good luck.',

    title: 'Eckerd Students In Support of Campus Makeover',
    date: '5/3/16',
    text:
      'Eckerd students expressed support this week for more organized and effective landscaping. This overwhelming movement goes against expectations of both the public and the administration. The work would cost $15,000 per semester to address the unruly shrubbery on campus. We visited Eckerd to find out exactly why students would pay more simply for appearances. According to many students we interviewed, the trees, shrubs and flowers of Eckerd’s campus have gotten out of control. From blocking sunset views to knocking over long-boarders with uplifted concrete, it seems nature has been on the attack. Bushes, often exceeding 10 feet in height, are taking over the skyline and the community has decided something must be done. \n Plants exhibiting natural growth are to be reshaped or removed. “We aim to have a beautiful campus” said one Eckerd junior, adding “ …many plants are asymmetrical and wild looking, so we cut them into perfect, organized boxes.” One argument for the 2 year long, campus-wide makeover was that athletes couldn’t discern field from forest. One athlete had this to say, “I’m running... and then boom, a tree. I proposed borders indicating where the grass ends and the trees begin. It’s really a matter of safety for me.” \n A student mentioned they appreciate seeing results, “I like waking to the productive buzz of a John Deere 2-stroke and finding orange pieces of plastic string around campus. This is solid evidence of our money going somewhere important.” Some students wanted more leisure space on campus. More grass fields have been added including seasonal sod in Hough Quad. A sand dune was also removed to make room for more smooth, soft beach sand devoid of any sharp or bumpy native grasses. This habitat removal also helps keep the campus clean by discouraging native animals. \n One student was concerned about getting in touch with nature and proposed more nature viewpoints on campus. Two mangroves were removed to make room for a mangrove observation pier that allows the community to observe local wildlife in their natural mangrove habitat. This pier is across from the sailing center which has another great view of the mangroves. \n We asked the administration about the decision. “We think this is a great idea. The naturally wild, outside-the-box plants don’t fit our image. We are trying to attract a certain type of student and this makeover will bring more of them here.“ President Ronald Westman said. No comment was made about the effect of this demographic change on the feel of Eckerd. \n At the college whose motto is ‘Think Outside’, Eckerd College is truly redefining the outside.',
